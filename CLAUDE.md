# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a **Claude Code plugin marketplace** - a monorepo containing example plugins demonstrating different plugin capabilities. Users install this marketplace to access all contained plugins.

## Architecture

### Two-Level Structure

The marketplace has a **registry** (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`) that references individual **plugins** (`plugins/*/`). Each plugin is self-contained with its own metadata.

```
.claude-plugin/marketplace.json   → Central registry (lists all plugins)
plugins/python-dev/               → Comprehensive Python dev plugin (skills + commands)
```

### Plugin Types & Key Differences

1. **Slash Commands** (user-invoked): Filename in `commands/*.md` becomes command name (e.g., `hello.md` → `/hello`)
2. **Agent Skills** (autonomous): Must be in `skills/skill-name/SKILL.md` format. Claude decides when to invoke.
3. **MCP Servers** (external tools): Configured in plugin's `plugin.json` under `"mcp"` key with command/args

### Required Plugin Files

Every plugin needs:
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` - Metadata (name, version, author, description)
- `README.md` - User documentation

## Adding a New Plugin

1. **Copy template**:
   ```bash
   cp -r plugins/python-dev plugins/my-plugin       # Use python-dev as template
   ```

2. **Update metadata** in `plugins/my-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`:
   - Change `name`, `description`, `version`
   - Update `author` (name and email)

3. **Register in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`**:
   - Add entry to `plugins` array
   - Set `source` to `"./plugins/my-plugin"`
   - Choose appropriate `category`: development, testing, documentation, productivity, devops

4. **Test locally** before committing:
   ```bash
   cp -r plugins/my-plugin ~/.claude/plugins/
   # Reload Claude Code or use /plugin list
   ```

## Validation Commands

```bash
# Validate marketplace.json structure
cat .claude-plugin/marketplace.json | jq .

# Validate all plugin.json files
find plugins -name "plugin.json" -exec jq . {} \;
```

## Critical Implementation Details

### Slash Command Naming
The `.md` filename **IS** the command name (without extension). Example:
- `commands/python-setup.md` → `/python-setup` command
- File contains markdown instructions that Claude follows when command is invoked

### Agent Skill Structure
Directory structure matters for skills:
```
skills/
└── skill-name/           ← Directory name is the skill name (hyphen-case)
    └── SKILL.md         ← Must be named exactly "SKILL.md"
```

**CRITICAL**: SKILL.md must start with YAML frontmatter:
```yaml
---
name: skill-name         # Must match directory name exactly
description: Complete description (1-3 sentences) explaining what, when, and key capabilities
---
```

Skills should define:
- **Capabilities**: What the skill can do
- **Usage**: When to activate (trigger conditions)
- **Approach**: Step-by-step execution plan
- **Output Format**: Expected result structure

See `SKILL_BEST_PRACTICES.md` for complete requirements.

### MCP Server Configuration
MCP servers are defined in the plugin's `plugin.json`:
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "server-name": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem"],
        "description": "Provides filesystem access",
        "env": {
          "API_KEY": "${API_KEY}"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
- Use `npx -y` for npm packages (auto-installs if missing)
- Reference environment variables with `${VAR_NAME}` syntax
- Never commit secrets or API keys

## Marketplace Owner

Current owner: **Tasanakorn Phaipool** (tasanakorn@gmail.com)

Users install this marketplace with:

## Stele Shared Memory Protocol

**Scope:** `cc-marketplace` | **Type:** monorepo

### Hybrid Storage Strategy

Stele provides two complementary memory systems. Use both.

- **Flat Memory** — Operational facts, decisions, conventions, troubleshooting notes. Scoped key-value prose entries.
- **Knowledge Graph** — Structural relationships between entities (plugins, components, people, dependencies).

**Rule of thumb:** If it's a **fact or note** → flat memory. If it's a **thing with relationships** → knowledge graph.

| Use flat memories for...            | Use knowledge graph for...          |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Decisions and their rationale       | Architecture and component maps     |
| Coding conventions and style rules  | People and ownership                |
| Troubleshooting steps               | Dependencies between services       |
| External references and links       | Data flow and call chains           |
| Onboarding notes                    | Entity facts (observations)         |

### On Boot (every task start)

Pull the latest shared state. Do not assume you know the current state.

```
recall_memories(scope: "cc-marketplace")
search_nodes(query: "*", scope: "cc-marketplace")
```

### Update-on-Change Protocol (Autonomous)

Update remote memory immediately when any of the following change:

- **Contract Changes** — API signatures, env vars, shared interfaces → tag `#contract`, `#breaking`
- **Lessons Learned** — Non-obvious bug fixes → tag `#wisdom`
- **Relationship Discovery** — New dependencies between components → `create_relations`

### Tagging Convention

| Tag          | Meaning                                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `#active`    | Currently implemented and enforced rules               |
| `#todo`      | Technical debt or pending migrations                   |
| `#contract`  | Inter-service API definitions and shared interfaces    |
| `#breaking`  | Changes that require other agents/services to update   |
| `#wisdom`    | Non-obvious technical discoveries and gotchas          |
| `#conflict`  | Local rule that conflicts with a workspace-level rule  |
| `#cross-pkg` | Cross-package concerns                                 |
| `#build`     | Build system and CI changes                            |
| `#shared`    | Shared module updates                                  |

### Scope Guide

| Scope                       | What it covers              |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `cc-marketplace`            | Workspace-wide standards    |
| `cc-marketplace/plugins`    | Plugin-specific knowledge   |
